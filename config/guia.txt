Configure winbgim library in Codeblocks.
Create a folder in any directory and give the name "WinBGIm" and create include and lib folder inside it. (eg. c:\WinBGIm\include and c:\WinBGIm\lib).
From the project created above, copy "graphics.h" and "winbgim.h" header files and paste it inside include directory, and "libbgi.a" file from bin/release project folder and paste it inside lib directory that you have created in step 2. (eg. c:\WinBGIm\include and c:\WinBGIm\lib). 
Open the code::blocks and go to File -> New -> Project or click create a new project link from the start page.
From the project wizard select "empty project" and click "Go" button and provide all necessary information. 
Also, do not forget to  add main.cpp file.
Go to menu bar and select project-> Project properties. A dialogue box will appear and click "Project's build options". 
Another dialogue box will appear and click the "Search directories" tab. Under "Compiler" tab provide the path of WinBGIm include folder (e.g. c:\WinBGIm\include) and under "Linker" tab provide the path of WinBGIm lib folder (e.g. c:\WinBGIm\lib).
Select "Linker Setting" tab and add "libbgi.a" file e.g path c:\WinBGIm\lib\libbgi.a. 
In "Other linker options" text box add linkers -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32
